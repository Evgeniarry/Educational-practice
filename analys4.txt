â€¢	Scientists have discovered a series of strange magnetic waves that roll across the surface of Earthâ€™s outer core.â€¢	These waves occur periodicallyâ€”about once every seven yearsâ€”and are thought to be generated by changes in flow of the coreâ€™s molten material.â€¢	Learning about these strange features could help researchers better understand our planetâ€™s bizarre magnetic field.________________________________________Earthâ€™s wily magnetic field is keeping scientists on their toes.A team of scientists in Belgium and France have discovered a new type of magnetic waveâ€”called a Magneto-Coriolis waveâ€”that courses across the surface of Earthâ€™s outer core every seven years. The researchers analyzed yearsâ€™ worth of satellite data from magnetic field-scanning satellites to build a model of the bizarre waves.ğŸŒ Youâ€™re obsessed with our weird world. So are we. Letâ€™s unearth its mysteries together.Earthâ€™s magnetic field, also known as the â€œmagnetosphere,â€ is vital in sustaining life on our planet. This vast bubble of charged particles wraps around our planet like a cometâ€™s tail, protecting us from a barrage of both solar and cosmic radiation. In essence, it has turned Earth into a giant dipole magnet, helping to orient the navigation systems that direct everything from our smartphones to satellites.MORE FROM POPULAR MECHANICSThe Missing Square PuzzlePlay VideoEarthâ€™s magnetosphere is generated in our planetâ€™s outer core, a churning sea of molten iron roughly 1,800 feet below the surface. Electrically charged particles in the outer core form convective cells, which produce an electric current that forms what scientists call a â€œdynamo.â€ This process is what forms Earth's magnetic field, or magnetosphere.FIELD OF DREAMS Birds Use Earthâ€™s Magnetic Field Like a Compass Two Blobs Blamed for Wandering Magnetic North Pole This Is the World's Strongest Magnetic FieldADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOWOur magnetic field is a particularly weird one. It periodically flips, sending the magnetic north pole to the southern hemisphere and vice versa. (Fear a reasonable amount: The last polar reversal occurred 780,000 years ago. Technically, we are overdue for a pole swap, but experts agree weâ€™d probably be able to adjust.) In recent yearsâ€”geologically speaking, that isâ€”scientists have noticed other bizarre behavior. The magnetic north pole, for example, is slithering eastward at break-neck speed. And in one region between Africa and South America, the field is even weakening. While understanding these idiosyncrasies has become a priority for many earth scientists, thereâ€™s still a lot that we donâ€™t know.To get a better handle on exactly what the heck is going on with our extremely (!) important (!) magnetosphere, scientists have been sending satellites into Earthâ€™s orbit to study it. The European Space Agency (ESA) launched the Swarm mission in 2013, and the trio of satellites that comprise it have been making important discoveries about Earthâ€™s magnetic field and the innerworkings of our planet ever since. Swarm isnâ€™t the first series of satellites to take on the task, though. Both the German Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) mission and the Danish Ã˜rsted mission, which launched in 2000 and 1999, respectively, worked for about a combined 25 years to study Earthâ€™s magnetic field.This content is imported from YouTube.

The waves are strongestâ€”or rather, their impact to the magnetic field is the greatestâ€”near the equatorial region of the outer core.The researchers report a number of factors that may influence the behavior and characteristics of these waves and others like it, including changes in the fluidity and buoyancy of the material in Earthâ€™s core, the rotation of the planet along its axis, and even interactions with magnetic material around Earth. They also believe there could be even more types of magnetic waves yet to be discovered. They published their results earlier this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences. The newly-discovered magnetic waves are oriented along the axis of Earthâ€™s rotation.UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITÃ‰ GRENOBLE ALPESADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOWFor years, scientists have suspected these waves might exist, but they werenâ€™t sure when they appeared or for how long they might last. This is the first time they have been observed. While Earthâ€™s surface is covered by a vast array of magnetic field-detecting instruments, it took the satellitesâ€™ birdâ€™s-eye view of the Earth and its inner layers to help researchers crack the case.The more we learn about Earthâ€™s magnetic field, the better we can predict and understand its behavior and processes. â€œThis current research is certainly going to improve the scientific model of the magnetic field within Earthâ€™s outer core. It may also give us new insight into the electrical conductivity of the lowermost part of the mantle and also of Earthâ€™s thermal history,â€ Ilias Daras, a geodesy and solid earth scientist who works on the Swarm mission, said in an ESA press statement earlier this week.THIS PLANET IS WEIRD, MAN How Earth Will Become One Big Supercontinent Again Earth Is Running Out of Sand, Which Is Concerning Why Does Earth Pulsate Every 26 Seconds?Studies like these could also teach us about other worlds in our solar system and beyond that have a magnetic field. Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune all have magnetic fields. (Jupiterâ€™s is the largest and most powerful; Mercuryâ€™s is the weakest.) Curiously, Jupiterâ€™s moon, Ganymede, also has a magnetosphereâ€”it the only moon in our solar system to possess oneâ€”which was discovered in 1996 when the Galileo spacecraft spotted aurorae.Itâ€™s helpful to learn more about this curious feature of our planet, but itâ€™s probably just as useful to accept that thereâ€™s not anything we can do about its changes.This content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

What are the degrees longitude correction needed to find magnetic North now?The Takeaway: Snapchat has released its first camera drone, the Snap Pixy. And after testing, I can say that no other selfie drone is as easy to operate. Iâ€™ve spent the past two weeks snapping beach shots, poolside portraits, and elevated mountain orbits, and the camera hasnâ€™t faltered in nabbing shots at a variety of overhead angles. Along with the surprisingly clear and stable 2.7K image, the Pixy boasts fast export speeds over its built-in Wi-Fi connection. That said, this drone pilots itselfâ€”it isnâ€™t a UAV that you have control over for racing or flight. And because this is built to be essentially a portable airborne camera, the lightweight non-waterproof body canâ€™t stand up to elements beyond a drizzle or winds harsher than 12 miles per hour. But at $250 all-in for the drone, two extra batteries, and a bumper necklace for carrying it around, this is the drone that even new pilots can use to autonomously grab shots and capture memories from a whole new perspective.Specsâ€¢	Camera resolution: 2.7Kâ€¢	Onboard memory storage: 16 GBâ€¢	Shoot modes: Hover, reveal, follow, orbit, and customâ€¢	Battery life: 4 minutes per battery, of which there are three for a total of 12 minutesâ€¢	Size: 5 x 4 inchesâ€¢	Weight: 0.2 pounds
